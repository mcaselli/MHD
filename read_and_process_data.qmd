# municipalities in the teacher salary data that are not in the DOR data
```{r}
#find the sal that are not in inc
sal[!(sal$Municipality %in% inc$Municipality),] %>%
  arrange(desc(FTE.Count)) %>%
  datatable(filter="top", rownames = FALSE)
```


# Municipalities dropped from the DOR data for missing teacher salary data
```{r}
rev_inc %>%
  filter(Municipality %in% setdiff(rev_inc$Municipality, rev_inc_sal$Municipality)) %>%
  datatable(filter="top", rownames=FALSE)
```

NOTE we can get some of these back by assigning the municipality to their 
appropriate regional school district e.g. Hamilton and Wehnam to Hamilton-Wenham
